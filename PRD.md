## 🧩 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### **Product Name**

**FoundrMatch.AI** — Your Private AI Chief of Staff for Finding the Right Technical Cofounder

---

## 1. 🎯 **Purpose and Problem Statement**

Nontechnical founders often struggle to identify, evaluate, and collaborate with technical cofounders due to:

* Lack of vetting tools that assess skill alignment and reliability
* Poor integration across the platforms they already use (Slack, GitHub, Zoom, etc.)
* Privacy and IP risks when sharing early product concepts
* Time-consuming outreach and due diligence processes

**FoundrMatch.AI** solves this by acting as an **AI Chief of Staff**, automating:

* Sourcing, vetting, and ranking potential cofounders
* Scheduling intro calls and managing due diligence
* Securely storing and analyzing communications with **ZeroDB encryption**
* Integrating your entire productivity stack into a unified decision dashboard

Would you like me to create **a companion TECH-STACK.md** and **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE diagram (mermaid format)** next?
That would make this PRD fully developer-ready.
