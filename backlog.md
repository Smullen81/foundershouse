## 🔄 Epic 9: Ethics & Community Trust (Detailed Below)

---

# 🧭 Ethics Framework for FoundrMatch.AI

Ethics are **core architecture**, not a policy add-on. This section defines **ethical principles**, **risk mitigations**, and **audit checkpoints** at product, AI, and data levels.

---

## 1️⃣ Principle: **Privacy by Design**

**Goal:** Ensure user and candidate data remain self-sovereign.

**Practices**

* All sensitive content stored in **ZeroDB**, never in plaintext.
* AI agents operate on temporary decrypted fragments inside MPC/MCP containers.
* Regular encryption audits (`AuditEvent` logged per operation).
* Key ownership: Founder only. No platform-side decryption possible.

---

## 2️⃣ Principle: **Transparency & Explainability**

**Goal:** Founders and candidates understand AI reasoning.

**Practices**

* AI outputs “Explain my recommendation” for every match.
* Stores `MatchScore.explanation_ref` in ZeroDB with plain-language reasoning.
* Each automation lists its data sources (e.g., “GitHub commits,” “meeting sentiment”).
* No “black box” scoring: all weight vectors visible to the user.

---

## 3️⃣ Principle: **Fairness & Anti-Bias**

**Goal:** Ensure AI avoids demographic or cultural bias in candidate evaluation.

**Practices**

* Use skill-based vetting only (public repos, projects, communication behavior).
* Remove name, gender, and location before scoring embeddings.
* Regular fairness audit (MCP EthicsAgent runs bias-detection reports weekly).
* Allow user override to correct false negatives.

---

## 4️⃣ Principle: **Consent and Mutual Respect**

**Goal:** Respect autonomy of both founders and candidates.

**Practices**

* Explicit candidate consent required before analysis of public data.
* Outreach messages must include “opt out of AI profiling” link.
* Founder cannot upload private info about others without consent.
* MCP agents refuse tasks violating consent boundaries.

---

## 5️⃣ Principle: **Human Oversight**

**Goal:** AI aids decision-making, not replaces it.

**Practices**

* Every automated recommendation requires founder confirmation.
* AI cannot auto-accept offers or send payments without human sign-off.
* “Explainable Decision Summary” before finalizing matches.

---

## 6️⃣ Principle: **Data Minimization**

**Goal:** Collect only what is essential.

**Practices**

* Avoid storing resumes if GitHub/LinkedIn data suffice.
* Transcript analysis limited to communication tone and action items.
* Delete trial candidate data after 30 days if no collaboration proceeds.

---

## 7️⃣ Principle: **Security and Accountability**

**Goal:** Prevent misuse of sensitive or proprietary startup data.

**Practices**

* Zero-trust policy: No shared admin read rights.
* Enforce audit trails for all MCP actions.
* Detect anomalies (unauthorized decryption attempts).
* Mandatory breach disclosure within 24h (founder and candidates notified).

---

## 8️⃣ Principle: **Ethical Monetization**

**Goal:** Prevent exploitation or “pay-to-win” matching.

**Practices**

* Free tier retains fair access to basic matching.
* AI weighting unaffected by payment tier.
* Clear disclosure of what each paid plan adds (tools, not ranking).

---

## 9️⃣ Principle: **Social Impact & Inclusion**

**Goal:** Encourage diverse, mission-driven teams.

**Practices**

* Promote matches that increase diversity (skills, geography, background).
* Offer free credits to underrepresented founders.
* Partner with diversity-focused tech communities (e.g., AfroTech, Women Who Code).
